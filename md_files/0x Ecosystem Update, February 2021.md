### üåê Network Insights

0x smashed through previous all-time-highs for daily volume, monthly volume,
and collected protocol fees in February üéâ

February 23rd saw **$455M** daily trading volume and a whopping **$6.6B** was
traded during the month of February. It‚Äôs mind-blowing to think that trading
volume and protocol fees collected for Jan+Feb 2021 has already exceeded
2020‚Äôs total annual volume ü§Ø

At current ETH prices, generated protocol fees reached a record ~$763K in
February 2021. Protocol fees are distributed as liquidity rewards to market
makers and token holders who [stake their ZRX](https://0x.org/zrx) through
0x.org.

January saw the [release of 0x v4](https://blog.0xproject.com/say-hello-
to-0x-v4-ce87ca38e3ac) and adoption has continued to increase throughout
February. At the time of writing around 75% of trades are now being routed
through v4. Rapid adoption was made possible due to the large number of
integrators now building on top of [0x API](https://0x.org/api).
